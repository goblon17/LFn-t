## Difficulties

|     Fitting all of the parts on one half-BreadBoard due to having only one.    |              Designing space efficient schematic.             |                                             Solution didn't work and had to get a second half-BreadBoard                                            |
| Fitting all 16 signals (2x 4 LEDs, 2x 4 Buttons) on 12 available Arduino pins. | LEDs can be connected in pairs so there are 12 total signals. | Solution worked, but both players get the same button to press and connecting LEDs was tricky (they had to be in parallel, each with own resistor). |
|             Held down button being read multiple times in program.             |       Wait for button to be released before continuing.       |                                   Side effect is that the program will not progress until the button is released.                                   |
|                    Getting seed for random number generator.                   |        Use value of disconnected analog port (here A0).       |                                    Reading disconnected analog port gives noise values which can be used as seed.                                   |

## Interesting code snippets

### Macro for easy getting the state of a button
```c++
#define isPressed(x) (digitalRead(x)==LOW)
```

### Waiting for either of the 2 buttons (`buttonP1` or `buttonP2`) to be pressed and saving their state
```c++
while ( (valP1 = digitalRead(buttonP1)) == HIGH && (valP2 = digitalRead(buttonP2)) == HIGH ) {}
```

### Printing number to LCD centered
```c++
char buf[4];
itoa(roundsNumber, buf, 10);
int pos = 8 - (strlen(buf) / 2);
lcd.setCursor(pos, 1);
lcd.printstr(buf);
```

### Waiting for the button to be let go of so there won't be a misinput on the next "*frame*"
```c++
while (isPressed(P1_BLUE) || isPressed(P2_BLUE)) {}
```
